## Predicting Solar Generation with Machine Learning
https://github.com/Stephens544/PV_Generation_Predictive_Model \ 
I trained a predictive model to forecast energy generation from weather data. Data sourced from Sheffield University API & Met website, and model built using XGboost. Final results presented on Jupyter with a 32.24GW MAE

## Solar Generation in the UK 2023-2024 
https://github.com/Stephens544/UKSolarGenerationByPES \
I represented Solar PV generation on a heatmap of the UK. Data sourced from an API and represented in areas defined by a GeoJson using shapely and matplotlib. The final 14 data points are represented on the visualisation, providing an overview of relative energy generation.

My solutions to Danny Ma's 8-week SQL Challenge (in progress). 

## Growth of EV Across the World - SQL
https://github.com/Stephens544/EV-Energy_Data_Transformation \
Cleaning data from various sources and building it into structured tables to be presented in Tableau.

## Growth of EV Across the World - Tableau 
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/max.stephens2043/viz/GrowthofEVAcrosstheWorld/GrowthofEVAcrosstheWorld \
An Interactive Dashboard telling the story of how EV went global over 11 years. Data for this project was gathered from Kaggle and the International Energy Agency, processed in SQL, and visualized on Tableau Public.  

The dashboard shows data points from the US, China, India, and Europe regarding charging points, EV stock and sales share, modes of EV, powertrains, and Energy Demand from EV in relation to renewable energy generation.
